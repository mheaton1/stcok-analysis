# Stock Analysis

## Overview 
###### We were presented with data for two different years. The idea was that we were going to help Steven figure out what his parents should invest in. 


## Results

Provided are screenshots of the run-times for the stock analysis for years 2017 and 2018.


## Original code

## Refactored code

###### From these screenshots you can conclude that the refactered code was quicker by almost .3 of a seconds. Instead of looping through the code multiple times we had refactored the code to run through all the data at once.

## 2018 stock data

###### Our code helped Steven determine which stocks are worth investing in as well as showed us how each years stocks preformed. Since our VBA code was able to color code the positive and negative returns we can easily see that 2017 was a better year for these specific tickers. 

## Summary
Refactoring a code can have its benefits when we are trying to loop through a large list of data. However, it could become a little bit confusing if there is something that is wrong and does not work it could make you have to start completely from the begining. While refactoring our code I had gotten a little confused when formating the for loop for all the rows. There was a lot of changes to be made for that specific part of the code and I did struggle with getting it to work. Eventually I was able to work everything out and have a functional code in the end.
